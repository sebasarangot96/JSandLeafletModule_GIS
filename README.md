Developing Web-Applications with JS and Leaflet:

In my GIS Specialization at UNIGIS - Salzburg i took an optional module for Developing Web-Applications with JS and Leaflet. 

There were three Assigtments that are shown here in this Github. 

Assigment 1 : 
Task A: Calculate cylinder volume.
Task B: Sum up odd numbers.
Task C: Create an object. 

Assigment 2 : Calculation page for the distance between a point and the little
mermaid in Copenhagen using events and DOM manipulation. 

Assigment 3: Creation of a leaflet map and visualize airports in Ontario,
Canada.
